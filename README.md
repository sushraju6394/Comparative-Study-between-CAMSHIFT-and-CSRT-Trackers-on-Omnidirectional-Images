# Comparative Study between CAMSHIFT and CSRT Trackers on Omnidirectional Images
Tracking plays a very pivotal role in the image processing domain. Various methods of
tracking have been successfully implemented on perspective and omnidirectional images. 
The focus of this research project is to analyze the efficiency of tracking a person
under omnidirectional images using two tracking filters named Continuously Adap-
tive Mean Shift (CAMSHIFT) and Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracker (CSRT)
respectively. This research work validates and tests the methods used to track the
person in a complex environment. Traditional CAMSHIFT works well for perspec-
tive images, but on omnidirectional images, it lost the target. On modifying the
CAMSHIFT algorithm, no significant improvements were observed. Bank of features
and subsequent region of interest update techniques were adopted in CAMSHIFT.
On the other hand, CSRT performed better than CAMSHIFT. An efficiency rate of
70.1% and 45.6% were obtained overall for CSRT and CAMSHIFT respectively.
